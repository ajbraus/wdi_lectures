##Ancient Computers

[Abacus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus) — Babylon, 2400 BC. Earliest known tool for computation. 

[Antikythera Mechanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism) — Greece, 205 BCE. First mechanical analog computer, purposed for astronomy.

##Cryptography

This history of [Cryptography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography), which flourished during the Renaissance, has heavily influenced and inspired the history of modern computing.

Essentially both are a system that heavily leverage the power of algorithms and data structures. As a result, knowledge in this field would later benefit the world of computing.

Additionally, during the Allied-Axis computing-race of WWII, cryptography was the raison-d'être for the birth of the modern computer.

##The Beginnings of Programming

[**Ada Lovelace**](https://www.sdsc.edu/ScienceWomen/lovelace.html):
1815 - 1852

A British mathematician regarded as being the first computer programmer. She wrote out algorithms for the design of Charles Babbage's [Analytical Engine's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine), the first general-purpose, Turing-complete computer.

Babbage was inspired by the automated [Jacquard Loom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_loom) to produce a general purpose automated machine. Ada was one of the first to theoretically attempt to design the patterns in which to feed it operating instructions.

Though her programs were not actually implemented, her most famous work is her "plan" (aka program) for computer to calculate the [Bernoulli numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_number). 

She self described her work as "poetical science" and first coined the computing term "library".

##Modern Computers

Not until WWII would the first true computers be created. The argument for what the first computer is heavily depends on how you define one. Here are some of the earliest examples:

[Z1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z1_%28computer%29) - *Germany, 1936.* First programmable computer.

[Colossus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer) — *Britain, 1943.* First electric programmable computer.

[ENIAC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC) — *USA, 1946.* First digital computer.

##Initial Programming Languages

Limitations of speed and memory forced programmer to write in [assembly language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language), so higher level languages evolved in order to reduce errors and increase expressiveness.

[Plankalkül](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankalk%C3%BCl) — *Germany, 1948.* First high-level programming language.

[A-0]() — *Remington Rand, 1952.* [Grace Hopper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper) invented the compiler and enabled A-0 to be the first [compiled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language) language.

[FORTRAN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) & [COBOL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL) — *IBM & Department of Defense, late '50s.* More advanced and universal compiled languages.

[LISP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29) — *MIT, 1958.* Second oldest compiled language and one of the first [functional](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) languages. It has been the preferred choice for those in field of AI. It has spawned many "dialects" that are still in use today.

[BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) — *Dartmouth, 1964.* A high-level language that emphasized ease of use for mass distribution on microcomputers. It still exists in part today in [Visual Basic .NET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_.NET).

[C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29) — *AT&T Bell Labs, 1969.* A prolific language due in part to it's implementation into [UNIX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) and a set standardization by the American National Standards Institute.

##Modern Computer Languages

[C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), [C#](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29), [Objective-C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C) — *AT&T Bell Labs, Microsoft, Apple, mid 80s.* Different flavors of C that build upon the the language's core components.

[Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29) - *Sun Microsystems, 1995.* Enabled programs to run on virtually any computer hardware via the [Java Virtual Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine), which facilitated much of the early growth of the internet.

[Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29), [Ruby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29), & [PHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) — *Individuals, mid 90s.* Very high-level, general-purpose, scripting languages.

[JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) aka ECMAscript — *Netscape, 1995.* The linga-franca of the browser. Not explicitly related to Java. Apparently designed in 10 days; it has come a long way since its inception.
